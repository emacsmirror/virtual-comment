#+startup:    content indent

* overview, design
because parsing the text file is tedious store in elisp format and have a
special mode to read it and show it in a buffer.

persistent file is project based or global

must have something like project based management mechanism to share 

such as tide.

when a buffer with icl mode on started up it will locate its project root which resolves
to global or project root. The project root is now a unique key to indentify the comment store

there is a global comment store which is a map of project  root -> project comment store

project comment store:
- comments: (file (line . comment)...)
- count: number of active buffers reading this store, when is is down to zero comments will be set to nil
- hook: this hook runs on store changed

** use case:
in project A, buffer a starts up and gets its project unique key as A,
From the global comment stores it gets it project comment store.
It is nil and the count is now set to 0.
With the count value it knows that it is the first one to access this store. 
It updates the count to one and initializes comments value for project.
Then it reads the comments from the store and show the comments in buffers.

Next a buffer b in project A starts up, and follows the same procedure but the
count is already greater than 0 so it means the project comment store is
already set up to go. So buffer b will just use the store and increase the count.

Some time later buffer b closes, it will decrease the count. It check the count
is still greater than 0

And finally buffer a is about to close. After decreasing the count to 0, that
means it is the last consumer of the store so it set the comment variable to
nil. Persist the data to a .ilc file

No memory leak this way.
** occur mode add marker info to text 
(get-text-property (point) 'occur-target)

use propertize to make string
